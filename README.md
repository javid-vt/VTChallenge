# VTChallenge
I have attempted this exercise using Java and have used only one class to handle all tests. I have used a helper class for verification methods which I could reuse where ever needed to avoid duplication. I think this is sufficient for this exercise however, for production environment this would not be sufficient to scale up. For that I would use page object model using PageFactory.   

Tests can be executed by navigating to project folder and executing:
- mvn test or
- through IDE(Eclipse) selecting either pom.xml right clicking and selecting Run as -> maven test or
- TestNG.xml and right clicking and selecting Run as TestNG suite
